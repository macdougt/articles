Docker and aliases
------------------

Living a happy life often involves avoiding unnecessary time soaks like sitting in traffic whenever possible. The Zen minded might tell me to accept the struggle, but I even like saving seconds when possible. It led me to create some aliases and utilities to help save keystrokes when I use docker.

I have to admit that I did not know about bash completions for docker and the docker toolset when I first wrote the aliases and accompanying scripts. Also if you are squeamish about Perl, do not dig into the scripts.
