# Reaching across the divide

Connection and information sharing can be very challenging and are made more difficult when your audience is never physically with you.

How do we overcome the many avenues of information presentation? There are so many services that offer to host your information, not to mention self hosting. If only the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) took hold. How can we encourage people to add metadata to their content so that it can be consumed with relative ease? This is a problem of motivation and discipline. I suppose if the audiences only consumed well formed data then we might see a shift but I do not see that happening anytime soon and hence we use search engines and many of them.

With the heterogenous nature of data, we are often forced to classify on our own. So a quick answer may be to automate the collection of data from sources of our choosing and adding indices where possible. This is especially helpful when the data sources are not accessible to the internet at large.

Scoring the content with our own metrics can also make sense. The practicality of content is very important to me. Perhaps we need a scoring (analysis, likes, stars, visits, etc) method to help us decide what is valuable, however, I do not want to boost the need for virtual approval.

### Software development perspective

We may also want to search with a purpose (e.g. searching for runnable content, containerized, helm, scripts). Of course, tagging/labelling would help, maybe this can be performed by tooling. Also providing content providers with templates, guidance and tooling will reduce friction and required effort. And then there is the problem of how to encourage people to share in a way that helps us find pertinent information.

I suggest that articles that are pedalling a software solution provide a repository that can be cloned and executed with very little effort or maybe even executed remotely?

### Employment perspective

How can we bring the office dynamic to our remote work? I know that people might gag at this discussion, so feel free to stop reading.

Quick ideas shared:
  - Office hours (people work together on a shared video call, you can drop in and watch a shared desktop)
  - Of course, online gaming with colleagues
  - Virtual coffee breaks

There are many, many [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=improve+engagement+and+connnectivity+while+working+remotely&oq=improve+engagement+and+connnectivity+while+working+remotely) about how to improve connectivity and engagement for remote workers.

I feel like educational institutions and edtech should offer solutions to this problem. One of school's biggest values to me was the community. If you ask most students why they might want to return to "physical" school, I believe that they would say friends.

## Human perspective

Remote work/play can emphasize the detached feeling from others, but is essential to feel connected. I can only go by how it works for me but I feel very differently when physically present with family, friends and colleagues. There is a different excitement level when talking to someone right in front of you. Video conferencing may be better than just voice and voice is better than texting which in turn is better than email, but they all fall short of real face to face reactions with body language. Maybe virtual reality will close the gap more in the future but I bet that even that will not be equal.

I think we need to focus on what might be possible using virtual technologies (e.g. co-op video games) that are not possible in real life and understand that these are two different ways to connect.
